== TODO

* cjk and/or multilingual support
* remove pdfmarks file after optimizing
* prawn-svg should drop layer with display: none style (issue filed, maybe fixed?)
* add note to README that Prawn will subset any fonts provided
* nested keep_together logic is broken (e.g., example inside example, listing inside sidebar, etc)
* look into single_line + shrink_to_fit in listings, perhaps other places
* refactor as Prawn view to avoid method name conflicts (also see https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/issues/802)
* SVG image is getting cut off when at boundary of page
* create proper default (Asciidoctor) theme
* start number for conum in theme
* implement compat lists (like in Asciidoctor EPUB3)
* list bullet in ordered list needs to grow with length of number
* document how the treetop parser is rebuilt
* rewrite optimize-pdf using rghost
* rework font so we can set actual height, calculate x_height internally (use 1em for spacings)
* padding top and bottom on content affects height_of calculations (need to review)
* enable fallback font (Golo guide has problem with License block)
* don't cutoff content in partintro
* use padding from theme around admonition block content
* use padding from theme around block quote content
* add admonition_label_font_color to theme
* remove remaining uses of vertical_rhythm and horizontal_rhythm
* implement subtitle on title page
* treat title-logo like the front-cover-image and back-cover-image (parse image macro)
* theme setting for code line height (currently using base_line_height)
  - in general, allow theme_font to set line_height
* print scratch.pdf file if verbose / trace mode is on in Asciidoctor
* introduce setting to indent section content
* design merge margin logic (like for admonition block)
* use font awesome for admonition icons
* support web fonts; use uri-cache to avoid redundant fetching
* rename default theme to docbook theme, make default the Asciidoctor theme (should we have a base theme?)
* add callout subs when using CodeRay and when using color themes in Pygments
* allow relative font size for inline code to be set (perhaps a percentage or em value? there are problems with this in arranger)
* set defaults in ThemeLoader for required theme settings like prose_margin_top/bottom so we don't need fallbacks in code
* implement orphan sentences for paragraph
* apply line height metrics for table content
  - figure out how to adjust line height for monospaced cell content
  - figure out how to layout regular cell content to adjust for line height
* document the typeset_text methods very clearly
* fix shading on listing that spans more than one page
  - in general, need to deal w/ situation if content in dry run is large than one page
  - need to deal w/ situation if content in dry run is large than one page
* move check for node.title? inside layout_caption
* theme idea / tester: see sandbox/ebook-learn_version_control_with_git-SAMPLE.pdf
* make alternating page title position optional (via theme?)
* BUG: page numbers are off in Clojure Cookbook
* image in header / banner (need to implement a masthead)

* enable pagenums attribute by default (may require changes to how we handle attributes)
* start page numbering on first page if no title page

* implement quote style from default Asciidoctor stylesheet
* reorg Prawn extensions (see prawn-table for example)
* rename "theme" to "style"?
* restrict custom theme path to jail (or load from load_path)
* add Optimizer class; wire to cli
* implement convert_toc
* can get orphan conum if starts on last line of page (fixed already?)
* only create title page if doctype=book
* disable monospace color in headings

* introduce method for start_initial_page?
* honor font defs in SVG (to get M+ 1p)
* callout matching in listing blocks is extremely fragile and doesn't handle two in one line
* make outline a document option (perhaps "outline" like "toc")
* shrink / squeeze source code to avoid wrapping (see original impl in nfjsmag, also shrink_to_fit)
* add bench/ directory for the script to test the speed of the formatted text parser
* start page numbering on page 1 (use /PageLabels reference to make i the title page number)
  - add this feature upstream to Prawn
* *report image only page w/ stamps corruption issue to Prawn*
* add /PageMode /UseOutlines
* what does fopub do to calculate scaling images? reduces width more?
* replace tabs with spaces in source code (Asciidoctor core change?)
* preamble on separate page?
* part on separate page for book doctype? (which other sections?)
* make default image scale width a theme setting
* cli arguments
  - theme (pdf-style, pdf-stylesdir)
  - enable/disable writing pdfmarks file
  - optimize-pdf
* section numbering
* implement footnotes correctly
* image border
* table footer
* flesh out outline more
* flesh out title page more
  - document subtitle (partially solved)
* don't create title page for article doctype
* chapter name in footer (need a proper hook for writing to the footer; perhaps also template in theme for footer text)
* implement toc and activate if toc is set on document (need to reorder pages)
* inline image
* callbacks for title page, new part, new chapter, etc
* split out render methods for chapter, part, section, etc
* custom subs in verbatim blocks
* captions/titles on all blocks that support them
* make font size and character spacing scaling of inline code part of theme
* might be able to avoid dry run for listing/literal in obvious cases
* implement index of index terms
* bw theme for CodeRay to match output of Pygments bw
* inline tabs should be replaced in layout_prose (etc) when normalize is enabled

* use treetop to parse and evaluate theme file
* make source code highlighting theme configurable (should be now, but has problems with conums)
* use or don't use pad method? check performance

== Documentation

* control page numbering using pagenums attribute
* "Incorrect number of arguments in 'SCN' command" happens when you add a stamp to an imported page
* be mindful that layout_prose adds margin to bottom of content by default (important when working in a bounding box)

== Open Questions

== Design

* remove/reduce padding above heading at start of page?
* Default line height?
* Heading font family / size / color
* Should the heading sizes be calculated according to the default font size?
* Page margins
* Body indentation?
* Size of masthead / footer
* Line separating masthead / footer?
* Separate title page
* Start chapter on new page?
* Special layout for chapter page?

=== Theme

* keep or drop base_ prefix in theme?
* does font_size_h* belong in headings section or base?
* how should we define custom fonts and paths to them?
* allow # in front of font color in theme file?
