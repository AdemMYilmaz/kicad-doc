KiCad Documentation
===================

The KiCad software tool come with an additional component library package
and a documentation package. Once you install all three packages you are
set with a full fledged software tool for PCB design. Any necessary
documentation will be then available from the Help menu of each KiCad
application (Eeschema, Cvpcb, etc.).  The same documentation is available
here too.

In this section you can find the official KiCad documentation in various
formats directly pooled from the
https://github.com/ciampix/kicad-doc/tree/master/src/[KiCad
experimental documentation repository].

*Developer documentation*

Currently there is three doxygen doc targets available to the developers,
these can be generated with make dev-docs, make doxygen-docs, and make
doxygen-python in the kicad source. For convience they are also available
on the following links and updaged by the Jenkins build server for each
commit, so the ones here should always be the latest. Note that the
doxygen-docs integrate the devdocs also, hence only two are linked here.

*Documentation in other languages*

The KiCad documentation is available in other languages too. Mind that
for languages either than English documents might be outdated.

*KiCad tutorials*

A fun way to start your journey into PCB design with KiCad is to have a
look at the many http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/Tutorials[KiCad
tutorial section].
