"CvPcb is typically invoked from the schematic capture program Eeschema. "
"Eeschema automatically passes the correct net list file name to CvPcb. "
"Before running CvPcb for the first time for each project, you must first "
"save the initial net list by selecting the “Generate Netlist” entry in to "
"“Tools” menu or click on the generate net list button on the top tool bar in "
"Eeschema. By default the net list file has the same name as the project with "
"a “net” file extension. If the net list file for the project already exists, "
"all footprint associations will be preserved. After the initial net list "
"file is created by Eeschema, CvPcb can be invoked directly from the KiCad "
"project manager. CvPcb can also be invoked as a stand alone program rather "
"than being launch from the KiCad project manager or the schematic editor. If "
"CvPcb is run as a stand alone program, the net list file must be opened "
"manually by selecting the “Open” entry in the “File” menu or clicking the "
"“Open” file button on the tool bar."
